## Why we created this App?

- Reorder Tasks – This one is really simple. One of the advantages of an app-based notes list is that you are not limited by ink on paper. Yet, many apps won’t let you easily re-organize the order of the notes on your list.

- Prioritization – This is another basic time management feature. It is important to be able to separate important tasks from the lesser ones.

- Simple UI – Following on from quick capture, overall the app should be simple.

- Notes List – You can’t do it all. And one of the best ways to “get work done” is to only concentrate on your top tasks for today. The ability to see a subset of “Hit List” for Today is important.

- Fun to Use – Last but not least, users have to want to use your productivity app. (Or any app!) People use tools they enjoy and work for them.
## User stories that you should cover:-

- As a user, I should be able to add my notes to the list and save it in local storage
- As a user, I should be able to edit my notes
- As a user, I should be able to remove any notes from my list (remove it from local storage)
- As a user, I can still have my list even if I close the browser window

## How do I get the project on my local machine?
- git clone https://github.com/MohamedSbaih/NotesApp.git
